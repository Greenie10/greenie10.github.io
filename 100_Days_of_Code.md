# 100 Days of Code

## 1) Using React Router 5â€™s useParams

In my Routing file, I enable the passing of the parameter `id` into my Foo component:

```javascript
<Route path="/foo/:id">
  <Foo>
    <Bar />
  </Foo>
</Route>
```

This `id` is then picked up from the URL in my Foo component with `useParams()` and passed though as a prop in my Bar component.

```javascript
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

const Foo = () => {
  let { id } = useParams();

  return <Bar id={id} />;
};
```

The `id` comes through in my Bar component as a destructured prop, ready to be used by a GraphQL mutation in the Bar component update a particular record.
